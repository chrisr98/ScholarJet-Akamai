Ymir: Hey!
Chris-Emio: Could you help me? 
Ymir: What can I help you with?
Chris-Emio: It may sound crazy, but I'm trying to piece my past together.
Ymir: That's not crazy at all. What type of information are you looking for?
Chris-Emio: Frankly, anything will do. Perhaps, a list of my skill sets?
Ymir: Well let's seeâ€¦
Ymir: Oh! You're pretty good with coding languages!
Ymir: You're a CS major. You told me that you were first inspired by your father.
Ymir: You were obsessed with gaming and followed that path to learn the basic of coding.
Ymir: You were pretty comfortable with the whole coding gibberish. 
Chris-Emio: Really?
Ymir: Yeah!
Ymir: I remember Steven telling me about a few of the projects you guys worked on together.
Ymir: You're very familiar with the C based languages...
Ymir: like JAVA, JAVAScript, C, C++, C#, and Python.
Ymir: You recently started working with HTML and CSS.
Chris-Emio: Sounds intense... intense but cool.
Ymir: Like I said you were good at what you did... I'm sure I'm missing a few things.
Ymir: Maybe someone else will have more insights.
Chris-Emio: Thanks Ymir. 
Ymir: Don't mention it!

Christa: Hey, Chris-Emio!
Chris-Emio: Hey, Christa!
Chris-Emio: I'm in a bind. Could you help me remember who I am?
Christa: I'm not sure how helpful I'll be.
Chris-Emio: That's okay. Anything you know about me will help.
Christa: I know you speak three languages fluently.
Chris-Emio: What are they?
Christa: English, French, and Haitian Creole.
Chris-Emio: I impress myself the more I learn about my past. I'm almost brilliant. 
Christa: Don't compliment yourself. It's weird. 
Chris-Emio: Duly noted.
